REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS
1.       Access to a computer, email, andCanvas.   Your computer, whether Mac   or PC   Windows   7+,
should have the ability to create Word documents and/or PDFS. Although   other browsers will   work, Google Chrome is the optimal browser to use with Canvas. Having   trouble   logging   on?   Contact   Student Technical   Support.   If   you’ve never used Canvas before, I   highly recommend   you   check   out   these   video   tutorials.
2.       Course readings will be provided as links or PDFs on   Canvas
3.       The Online   Writing   Lab   (OWL) at   Purdue   University
DISASTER PLAN
What will you do if   your internet connection is not working at home? What   if   Canvas   is   down   for   some   reason and a deadline is approaching? What if Saddleback’s email   system   is   down?   In   situations   like these a contingency plan is needed.
●         Check the announcements and/or go to   Student Technical   Support before emailing me   about      problems with Canvas. Remember, if   you email me after 5 pm   I   likely will not read   the   email   until the next day.
You should also develop your own disaster plan to allow you   to   work under   these   circumstances:
●         If   your home internet connection is down.
●         If   your computer stops working.
Here are a few   recommendations:
●         Utilize the on-campus computer lab.
●       Take tests on   a   direct   Ethernet   connection   as   opposed to   Wi-Fi.   If   your   Wi-Fi   connection   is   lost,   even briefly, your test will be submitted and closed.
●         Email me if   you have an emergency.
●       Email me your work if   turnitin.com   is   down, but   also   check back later   and   try   to upload   it   again.
Tips to minimize lost work:
●         Compose discussion posts in a word processor first. Then copy them   into the   discussion   thread.   Sometimes Canvas will fail t代 写English 1B: Principles of Composition II
代做程序编程语言o load an image and   all   of   the   text   typed   is   lost.
●         Save often.
●         Google docs will save your work history and autosave your work. You   all have   free   access to   google drive using your school email and password.
LATE ASSIGNMENTS
Every assignment has a due date, rubric, and   a deadline   for   submissions.   Students   are   expected   to   submit   assignments on or before the assigned   due date. I   feel   I would be   doing you   a   disservice by   allowing   you   to submit late work, as other instructors and   future   employers will   likely   not   allow   it.   With   that   said,   I   recognize that you are more than a student and have responsibilities beyond   our classroom.   I   understand      that things can happen while you're taking classes that can interfere with   your   success. You   can   advocate   for your success by communicating with me via email or stopping by my   office   during hours.   If   you   stop   participating in the class, there's no way for me to know if something's going   on with you   or   if   you've   just been forgetful. Therefore, should any issues arise while you're   in   this   class, please   know   that you   can (and should!) reach   out to   me.
COURSE CONTENT  TRIGGER WARNINGS
Please note that this class will cover readings and discussions that include   adult themes   and   issues.   We   may read, view, and discuss mature subject matter (relating to the   arts,   entertainment,   sexuality, race, class, immigration, war, religion, politics, nature, science, crime, violence, etc., as well   as   a range   of   points of   view on those issues). As challenging as those   subjects may be, you   are   encouraged to remain   in the class, to learn about diverse points of   view, and to--tactfully   and respectfully--contribute   your   point   of   view. If   you   would   like   to   be   warned   about   particular   content, please   inbox   me, and   I'll   be happy to prepare you via trigger warnings. All participants will honor this boundary. Please note that   hate speech is prohibited (definition: “any advocacy of   national, racial,   or religious hatred   that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence”).
ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS
Your study and workload for this course is approximately   10   hours per   week,   which   includes   both   class   attendance and work outside of   the classroom. Please plan to give an   adequate   amount   of   time   to   for the   substantial assigned readings, class discussion assignments, and essay   drafting   and revisions   each week.

A= Excellent   work   exemplifying   the   requirements   for   each   assignment   and   demonstrating   each   of   the          Learning   Objectives   required   for   this   course. Student   goes   beyond   the   minimum   requirements   and   does an   excellent   job   on   both   discussion   and   writing   assignments,   participates   actively, and   has   completed       every   assignment.

POLICY ON THE USE   OF AI
Unless otherwise specified by the faculty member,   all submissions,   whether   in   draft   or   final   form,   to meet course requirements (including papers, projects, exams, oral presentations, or other work) must   either be the student’s own work, or must clearly acknowledge the   source. Unless   an   instructor   indicates   otherwise, the use of   ChatGPT or other AI tools for course assignments   is   akin   to having   another person   do the work or receiving assistance from another person and raises the   same   concern that the   work   is   not   the student’s   own.
